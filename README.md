# Al3xWarrior's HTSL Files
Almost every part of all my houses past 2023 have been made using HTSL. Its an amazing tool that I genuinely don't think is possible to create houses without.

I've decided to make these files public so I could both show more of what I've accomplished on Housing as well as display to others how I went about certain things.

You might find leaks or unused content in here!
